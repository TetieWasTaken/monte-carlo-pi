## About
> This tool approximates π using the Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo method is a statistical method that uses random sampling to estimate numerical results. In this simulation, a circle is inscribed in a quadrant. The ratio between the area of the circle and the area of the square is π/4. By randomly selecting points in the quadrant, the ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points is used to approximate π.
